     <!-- Add your new language here -->
     <option value="ja">Japanese</option>
   </select>
   ```

2. Update the `getLanguageName` function in `scripts/popup.js`:
   ```javascript
   function getLanguageName(langCode) {
     const languages = {
       // Existing languages
       ja: "Japanese",
       // Add your new language here
     };
     return languages[langCode] || langCode;
   }
   ```

- **RTL Support**: Special handling for right-to-left languages like Persian and Arabic
